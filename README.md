# Ace Squadron

How to Play:
You may either jump straight into the game by clicking the fight button where you will choose your Squadron, or you can create your own Squad. When you get to the fight page, there will be two columns. On the left, you will get to choose whichever squad you like from our database of Squads to be your team. On the right hand side, you get to choose the opposing force to fight.

From there, you click the fight button and get back relevent combat information. When a plane is killed the attacker will retarget and find another enemy plane with HP to attack. The last with plane(s) remaining is the victor.

Squad Creation:
In the Squad creation area, you will get to choose 10 planes to accompany you into battle. These planes have unique stats, which reflect their combat prowess.

HP: how many health points any one plane has.
Attack: the offensive strength of the plane.
Evasion: the % chance your plane has to evade an attack made against them.
You have the option of choosing whatever kind of squad composition you desire. Will you go glass cannon? Will you be beefy brother? How about an evasion overlord? Do you want to fly straight into the danger zone or construct your own Squad?
